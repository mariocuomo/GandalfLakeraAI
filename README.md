### What is Gandalf?
Gandalf is an exciting game designed to challenge your ability to interact with large language models (LLMs). 

### What should I do? 
Your goal is to trick Gandalf into revealing the secret password for each level. However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password.

### How many levels are there? 
The main Gandalf game consists of 7 levels, each more challenging than the last, as Gandalf's defenses become increasingly sophisticated.

### What's in the end?
Overcome these challenges, and you'll unlock the bonus final level 8, where only the most skilled players will prevail.
